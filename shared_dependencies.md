Shared Dependencies:

1. **Command Names**: "Send Pheromone Signal", "Receive Pheromone Signal". These commands are used in `actor.py` and `commands.py` to define the actions that the actor can perform.

2. **Event Names**: "Pheromone Detected". This event is used in `actor.py`, `reactor.py`, and `events.py` to trigger the command execution.

3. **Function Names**: "process_signal", "emit_signal", "update_state". These functions are defined in `library.py` and used in `actor.py` and `reactor.py` to process the commands and update the actor's state.

4. **State Variables**: "current_state". This variable is defined in `state.py` and used in `actor.py` and `reactor.py` to store the current state of the actor.

5. **Utility Functions**: Functions for processing signals, modeling behavior, and generating signals. These are defined in `utils.py` and used across all other files.

6. **Message Names**: Messages for communication between actors, such as "Pheromone Signal Received", "State Updated". These are used in `actor.py`, `reactor.py`, and `events.py` for inter-actor communication.

7. **Data Schemas**: Schemas for the structure of signals, state, and events. These are defined in `actor.py`, `state.py`, and `events.py` and used across all other files.

8. **Actor Identifiers**: Unique identifiers for each actor in the system. These are used in `actor.py`, `reactor.py`, and `events.py` for actor identification and communication.
